 What to do:
 This code prints out useful information about the GPU(s) in your machine, 
 but there is much more data available in the cudaDeviceProp structure.

 Extend this code so that it prints out all the information about the GPU(s) in your system. 
 Also, and this is the fun part, be prepared to explain what each piece of information means.
