 What to do:
 This code uses the CPU to compute the dot product of two vectors of length N. 
 It includes a skeleton for setting up a GPU dot product, but that part is currently empty.
 Additionally, the CPU code is somewhat convoluted, but it is structured this way to parallel 
 the GPU code you will need to write. The program will also verify whether you have correctly 
 implemented the dot product on the GPU.
