 What to do:
 This code displays a simple Julia set fractal using the GPU.
 But it only runs on a window of 1024X1024.
 Extend it so that it can run on any given window size.
 Also, color it to your liking. I will judge you on your artisct flare. 
 Don't cute off your ear or anything but make Vincent wish he had, had a GPU.
