 What to do:
 This is some robust N-body code with all the bells and whistles removed. 
 It automatically detects the number of available GPUs on the machine and runs using all of them.
 Rewrite the code using CUDA unified memory to make it simpler and use cudaMemPrefetchAsyn to make
 the memory movement faster.
