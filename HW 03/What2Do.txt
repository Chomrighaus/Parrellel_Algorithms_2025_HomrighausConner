 What to do:
 This is the solution to HW2. It works well for adding vectors using a single block.
 But why use just one block?
 We have thousands of CUDA cores, so we should use many blocks to keep the SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors) on the GPU busy.

 Extend this code so that, given a block size, it will set the grid size to handle "almost" any vector addition.
 I say "almost" because there is a limit to how many blocks you can use, but this number is very large. 
 We will address this limitation in the next HW.

 Hard-code the block size to be 256.
