 What to do:
 This code generates a series of random numbers and places them into bins based on size ranges using the CPU. 
 Create a binning scheme that utilizes the GPU and takes advantage of both global and shared atomics. 
 The function call has already been created. Additionally, make the block size twice the number of multiprocessors.
