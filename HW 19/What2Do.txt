 What to do:
 This is some lean nBody code that runs on the GPU. But the number of bodies it can simulated is limited to 1024
 so it can run on one block. Extend this code so it can simulation as many bodies as the user wants (within reason).
 Keep the same general format. But you will need to change a few major things in the code.
 Note: The code takes two arguments as inputs:
 1. the number of bodies to simulate,
 2. Whether to draw sub-arrangements of the bodies during the simulation (1), or only the first and last arrangements (0).
