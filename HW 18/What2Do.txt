 What to do:
 This is some lean nBody code that runs on the CPU. Rewrite it, keeping the same general format, 
 but offload the compute-intensive parts of the code to the GPU for acceleration.
 Note: The code takes two arguments as inputs:
 1. The number of bodies to simulate, (We will keep the number of bodies under 1024 for this HW so it can be run on one block.)
 2. Whether to draw sub-arrangements of the bodies during the simulation (1), or only the first and last arrangements (0).
