 What to do:
 This code is the solution to HW8. It finds the dot product of vectors that are smaller than the block size.
 Extend this code so that it uses many blocks and many threads and can find the dot product of any vector length.
 Use shared memory in your blocks to speed up your code.
 You will have to do the final reduction on the CPU.
 Set your thread count to 200. Set N to different values to check your code.
