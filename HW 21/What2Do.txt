 What to do:
 This is some lean n-body code that runs on the GPU for any number of bodies (within reason). Take this code and make it 
 run as fast as possible using any tricks you know or can find. Try to keep the same general format so we can time it and 
 compare it with others' code. This will be a competition.
 Note: The code takes two arguments as inputs:
 1. The number of bodies to simulate: 10,752 bodies
 2. Whether to draw sub-arrangements of the bodies during the simulation (1), or only the first and last arrangements (0).
